type equation into desmos
copy equation
paste into program
no crazy shit like sum or anything i didnt code for

any variable should work unless its a desmos thing. like instead of x it could be fred or D1.

example:
\frac{\left(-1\right)^{\left(n+1\right)}}{e^{n}}
->
((-1)^((n+1)))/(e^(n))

very useful 👍
