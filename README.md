type equation into desmos

copy equation

paste into program

no crazy shit like sum or anything i didnt code for

any variable should work unless its a desmos thing. like instead of x it could be fred or D1.

example:

\frac{\left(-1\right)^{\left(n+1\right)}}{e^{n}}

->

((-1)^((n+1)))/(e^(n))

you might need to make sin/cos uppercase manually because i forgot and am lazy as shit.

very useful 👍

download .net6 if it doesnt work or something idk i dont think anyone will actually use this
